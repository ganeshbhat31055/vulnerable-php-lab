# Vulnerable Code
The aim of this code is to demonstrate a simple example of a vulnerable code that is susceptible to SQL injection attacks.

This is a simple PHP script that connects to a MySQL database and retrieves user information based on a username provided via a GET request. The code is vulnerable to SQL injection because it directly incorporates user input into the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
